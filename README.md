# 🚀 LeetCode DSA Journey (C++ Solutions)

Welcome to my **LeetCode Problem-Solving Repository** 🎯  
This repo documents my journey of solving **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** problems on LeetCode, with clean and optimized solutions in **C++**.  

---

## 🎯 Why This Journey?

- To **strengthen my fundamentals** in Data Structures & Algorithms  
- To **identify common patterns** across problems  
- To **prepare for coding interviews** and competitive programming  
- To build **consistency and discipline** in problem-solving  
- To inspire and help others by sharing structured solutions 🚀

## 📂 Topics Covered

I’m covering problems **topic by topic** in sequence, each with **75+ problems** (25+ Easy + 25+ Medium + 25+ Hard):  

1. 🔢 **Arrays**  
2. 🔤 **Strings**  
3. 🧱 **Stacks**  
4. 📊 **Queues**  
5. 🔗 **Linked Lists**  
6. 🌳 **Trees**  
7. 🌐 **Graphs**  
8. 🎲 **Dynamic Programming (DP)**  
9. ➕ Extra: **Math, Recursion, Backtracking, Bit Manipulation**

## 📌 Goals

- ✅ Solve **75+ problems per topic**  
- ✅ Maintain clean and **well-documented C++ code**  
- ✅ Track progress with READMEs for each difficulty  
- ✅ Share learnings & solutions on **GitHub + LinkedIn**  
- ✅ Build a **solid foundation** for technical interviews & problem-solving

## 🌱 How I’m Approaching This

- Solve **2–3 problems daily** (sometimes 1 if it’s very challenging)  
- Start from **fundamentals → advanced topics**  
- Focus not just on solving but on **understanding patterns** like:  
  - Two Pointers  
  - Sliding Window  
  - Binary Search  
  - Prefix/Suffix Techniques  
  - Hashing  
  - Greedy & Divide & Conquer  
  - Dynamic Programming
